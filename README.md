# Solar-efficiency-improvement-with-Dust-detection
custom-built sun detection sensor we created a system that follows the sun correctly and maximizes power generation. Which was done by LABVIEW using DAQ card. Project done by LABVIEW using DAQ card and image processing in MATLAB and C++ 
Image processing was used to detect and adjust accordingly if any dust or sand is covering the solar panel.
